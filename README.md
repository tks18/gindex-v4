##### What if Someone Violates my License ?

A CC license terminates automatically when its conditions are violated. For example, if a reuser of CC-licensed material does not provide the attribution required when sharing the work, then the user no longer has the right to continue using the material and may be liable for copyright infringement. The license is terminated for the user who violated the license. However, all other users still have a valid license, so long as they are in compliance.

Under the 4.0 licenses, a licensee automatically gets these rights back if she fixes the violation within 30 days of discovering it.

If you apply a Creative Commons license and a user violates the license conditions, you may opt to contact the person directly to ask them to rectify the situation or consult a lawyer to act on your behalf. Creative Commons is not a law firm and cannot represent you or give you legal advice, but there are lawyers who have identified themselves as interested in representing people in CC-related matters.

#### Complete Site Inspiration from [Aicirou](https://github.com/Aicirou)

*This is a Complete Rebuild from Aicirou's Gindex with Changes to Theme and Framework.*

**Important** - _This Site Requires My GIndex Live Backend Server to be Running Otherwise the Site will Never Open._

**Important** - _For Setting up of Backend. Visit my GIndex Backend [Repo](https://github.com/tks18/gindex-backend) for Steps to Setup._

#### Site Features Other than Aicirou's:

1. This GIndex is Not Like Basic GIndex which Depends on Basic Auth  Headers to Authenticate the Users. Rather this has its Own Backend Through Which Users will be Authenticated.
2. Automated Email Verification with OTP.
3. Uses Custom Video Player - Plyr to Stream Videos.
4. Uses Custom Audio Player - Plyr
5. Complete Dark theme.
6. User Role Based Authentication.
7. No Public can Access Site's Content Without Logging in.
8. Uses JWT to Verify User's Login on Each Route.
9. JWT is Valid for a Week. After Expiry the User will get Automatically Logged out.
10. Also User's JWT Token is Stored in LocalStorage as AES 256 Encrypted Key . This will be Decrypted on Demand. So that No One Can Access the User Details even if they have the Key.
11. Fully Material Redesign of all Pages. (Under Progress).
12. Has 3 Roles - User, Admins, Superadmins
	- Users - Can Only View Content.
	- Admins - Can Accept Users based on their Request
	- Superadmins - Can Accept Admin Requests.
13. Uses MongoDB for User Database.
14. Full Access Control of Backend from Frontend Based on User's Role.
